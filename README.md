Simple site generated largely by [v0](https://v0.app/), and I've just taken pieces of the html and adding onto it. I'm too lazy to have a linkedin and manage that. So I just use this. 
Also helps I can mess with CI/CD and my homelab like this.

Big thanks to [aebian](https://github.com/aebian) for the logo!

This repo is also largely my experimentation corner for CI/CD.
